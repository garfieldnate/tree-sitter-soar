# this program triggers a crash (null pointer) in gds_add_wme in both csoar and jsoar
# specifically, it crashes when trying to add (I1 ^ouput-link I3) to a null gds for a justification instance whose match goal is S1
# key aspects that seem to be required include:
#  working in a substate
#  creating a structure that gets put on the output-link (in the superstate)
#  elaborating something onto the structure before it gets returned
#  creating a wme on the substate when the structure is returned to the superstate
